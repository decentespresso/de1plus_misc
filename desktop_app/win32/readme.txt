Decent on Windows

Run "decent.bat" to run the normal decent app

Run "decent_webcast.bat" to run the app as a web page, which you can then access with a web browser, at http://localhost:8080
- note #1: the web service does not appear to work on Windows NT. You need a newer version of Windows.
- note #2: this uses FFMPEG for windows (32bit), which we have pre-included for you in the undroidwish/ directory.
