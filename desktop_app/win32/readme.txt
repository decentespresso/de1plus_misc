Decent on Windows

run "decent.bat" to run the normal decent app

run "decent_webcast.bat" to run the app as a web page, which you can then access on http://localhost:8080
- note #1: you will need to install FFMPEG for windows, with the DLLs into the windows\system32 directory, to make this work.  
- note #2: the web service does not appear to work on Windows NT. You need a newer version of Windows.
