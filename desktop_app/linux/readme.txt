Decent on Linux

Run the appropriate "decent_linux_(.*?).sh" shell script appropriate for your Linux version, to run the normal decent app

Run the "webcast" version of the script to run the app as a web page, which you can then access with a web browser, at http://localhost:8080
- note #1: you will need to install FFMPEG for Linux, to make the webcast version work.
